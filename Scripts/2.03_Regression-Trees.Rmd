# Introduction to Regression Trees:
- A regression model – predict a numeric outcome 
- The data can be continuous or integer valued
- Train a regression tree in R
rpart(formula = ---, data = ___, method = “anova”)
- we’ll use a training set, validation set (to tweak the parameters of the model), and test set

# Train a regression model
```{r}

grade <- read.csv("../Input/student-mat.csv")
# Set seed and create assignment
set.seed(1)
assignment <- sample(1:3, size = nrow(grade), prob = c(0.7,0.15,0.15), replace = TRUE)

# Create a train, validation and tests from the original data frame 
grade_train <- grade[assignment == 1, ]    # subset grade to training indices only
grade_valid <- grade[assignment == 2, ]  # subset grade to validation indices only
grade_test <- grade[assignment == 3, ]   # subset grade to test indices only
## Train the model
grade_model <- rpart(formula = final_grade ~ ., 
                     data = grade_train, 
                     method = "anova")

## Look at the model output                      
print(grade_model)
